Both Hisaye Yamamoto’s “Wilshire Bus” (1950) and Edward P. Jones’s “The Girl Who Raised Pigeons” (1993) explore the complexities of belonging, particularly for characters navigating marginalized identities within a larger, often unwelcoming, society. While both stories employ physical settings as crucial elements in their narratives, they diverge in their presentation of the relationship between place and belonging. "Wilshire Bus," confined to the titular vehicle traversing a rapidly modernizing Los Angeles, highlights the precarity of belonging in a space defined by transient interactions and societal prejudice. Conversely, "The Girl Who Raised Pigeons," set against the backdrop of a disappearing Black neighborhood in Washington D.C., suggests that true belonging transcends physical place, residing instead in personal connections and the enduring power of memory.
